**Lee, U.** and Xu, Z. (2022+) Design for immuno-oncology clinical trial with a het-
erogeneous patient population.

**Lee, U.** and Garcia, T.P. (2022+) JPRAT: an R package for the Joint Progression of
Risk Assessment Tool, which evaluates and compares all outcomes simultaneously
across multiple studies and adjusts for outcome dependencies. The description
for the detailed estimation procedure is in the following paper: Garcia, T. P.,

mega-analysis of clustered event times, Biostatistics, 20(1), 129-146.
